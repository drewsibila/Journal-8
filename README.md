### README Update

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their game "Draw It or Lose It" to work on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android. They needed a design that could work across all these platforms, handle more users, and be affordable to deploy.

I did a great job of making a clear and detailed design document. It covered all the important parts like system architecture, platform analysis, and what I recommend. It was easy for both the client and the development team to understand.

The design document acted like a roadmap for development. It helped spot potential problems early and provided a logical flow for coding. It made sure all the requirements were covered, making the development process smoother and reducing the need for major changes later.

I would revise the database schema section to improve how data is organized and make queries run faster. Better indexing strategies would make data retrieval and storage more efficient.

I understood the user’s needs by talking with the client and looking at feedback from the game's users. Implementing these needs made sure the game was user-friendly and smooth to play. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because it directly affects how easy and satisfying the software is to use.

I started by gathering all the requirements, making use case diagrams, and developing the system architecture and database design. In the future, I would keep using these techniques and add in iterative design processes like Agile for continuous feedback and improvements. Using prototyping tools for early UI design can also give useful insights before full-scale development.
